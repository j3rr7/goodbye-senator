# Introduction

Good day fellow programmers,

In the bustling technology, a small group of software engineers and web developers were finding themselves in a
recurring struggle. They were tasked with creating solutions for clients from various backgrounds, each with their own
unique challenges. One common issue they faced was dealing with clients who struggled to fulfill their responsibilities,
such as paying for the work done by the developers and programmers.

To address this issue, we decided to create a JavaScript library that would serve as a solution for their fellow
programmers facing the same struggles. The library, named "goodbye-senator", was designed to insert a few messages into
a website indicating that the site had not been paid for. However, the library was designed to keep the website intact,
ensuring that the user experience remained uninterrupted.

The "goodbye-senator" library was a testament to their commitment to improving the technology landscape, making it
easier for other developers to navigate the challenges of dealing with difficult clients. By creating this library, we
hoped to alleviate some of the stress and frustration associated with these situations, and perhaps inspire other
developers to do the same.
